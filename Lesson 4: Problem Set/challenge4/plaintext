m0, m6
	We shall not cease from exploration
	And the end of all our exploring
	Will be to arrive where we started
	And know the place for the first time.
	Through the unknown, unremembered gate
	When the last of earth left to discover
	Is that which was the beginning;
	At the source of the longest river
	The voice of the hidden waterfall
	And the children in the apple-tree
	Not known, because not looked for
	But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
	Between two waves of the sea.
	Quick now, here, now, always—
	A condition of complete simplicity
	(Costing not less than everything)
	And all shall be well and
	All manner of thing shall be well
	When the tongues of flame are in-folded
	Into the crowned knot of fire
	And the fire and the rose are one.

	(From “Little Gidding” by T.S. Eliot)

	Over the wintry forest, winds howl in rage

	Natsume Soseki
