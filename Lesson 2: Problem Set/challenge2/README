This was real easy and no code was needed to solve it...
Sorting the table and checking how many times each value was used revealed that
all numbers where used twice except 2 which were only used once.
So if the list was a duplicate then I only have to check the last number in the
list and find it somewhere else in the list and the answer would be the first
number after that one...
So the last number = 3231542850
Find it elsewhere in the list
Next number is = 1308607425
And that is the answer!
